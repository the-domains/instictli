  Created as a set of billboards along two Massachusetts highways, " Healing
  Tool" is a temporary public art installation by artist Brian Kane produced to
  temporarily relieve stress and promote introspection during one's monotonous
  daily commute. Kane's digital billboards circulate between pictures of
  surrounding natural environments, creating "unvertisements" that promote
  nothing instead of shoving products, restaurants, and services in consumers'
  faces from above.
